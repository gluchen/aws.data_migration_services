# aws.data_migration_services
a little toy to play with boto3 and AWS DMS, making it easier to control.

The goal behind this, is having an easy way to control a set of tasks in AWS [DMS](TODO: link to data migration services).

But for now, this is just a little toy to experiment with what boto3 has to offer, in terms of control of DMS and testing.
